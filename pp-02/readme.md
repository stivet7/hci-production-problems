## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13Z0u0k4H8m5FgE5ccO5A4d9H3K
Your Rationale: A majority of modern devices go for dark muted colors, mostly dark grays and blacks. There are usually some accent colors used that are slightly brighter hues of the base colors.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=a2S030kndsOkbzslKuYp1qVpUni
Your Rationale: Green is usually associated with springtime and its adjacent color red follows it most of the time. I went with less saturated hues to not come as strong or loud.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=31J1b0knQDmk5Mqm2I6pzz9rwvd
Your Rationale: Bright colors tend to be used a lot with children's media, so choosing bright yellow, red and blue seems like the right choice for a friendly looking app.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13l1b0keEGFj6ysgXC4ccL59HPb
Your Rationale: Cyan and other similar colors are used a lot with tech and cyber related imagery and visualizations. The bright color will attract a person's attention to whatever the course is being advertised through.
