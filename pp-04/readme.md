## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/
* Android Guidelines:
  https://developer.android.com/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://material.io/design/layout/spacing-methods.html
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: On mobile view the buttons and
overall layout of the form page seemed too close together. This is especially apparent when
looking at the text sections with the input parts above or in between them. I added more
appropriate spacing for the text and the input sections to make the page look less compressed.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://material.io/design/layout/density.html
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: For the buttons above the main
section of the page, they were too close together and had no type of separation or borders
against the bland grid background. Everything in the header section also suffered this density
issue so in my sketch I spread out the buttons and gave them borders to better differentiate them and make the top less cluttered.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://material.io/design/color/color-usage.html
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: The background of the page
is just a bland grid design that clashes with the main parts of the form being the same black
and white colors. It would be much better if the background was a solid color, which I
indicated on the sketch, and have the form of the page have a border to better contrast as
a whole for the user.
